# OrangeKit Contracts

Smart contracts powering OrangeKit.

## Development

### Installation

This project uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) as a package manager
([installation documentation](https://pnpm.io/installation)).

First, make sure you have the right node version used:

```bash
nvm use
```

To install dependencies run:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Testing

```
$ pnpm test
```

### Environment Setup

This project uses [dotenv-safer](https://github.com/vincentvella/dotenv-safer),
which provides environment variable checking. If there is a field in
`.env.example` but not `.env`, execution will halt early with an error.

As of today, only `MAINNET_RPC_URL` must be set. This value is used in tests to
fork the mainnet Ethereum chain.
