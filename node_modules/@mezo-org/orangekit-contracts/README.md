# OrangeKit Contracts Artifacts

Artifacts of OrangeKit contracts deployed to supported networks.

The main `index.ts` file contains ABIs and addresses of contracts generated by
the [`@wagmi/cli`](https://wagmi.sh/cli) tool, that can be used for type-safe
contracts integration with [Viem](https://viem.sh/).

The `deployments/` directory contains artifacts of contracts generated by
Hardhat.

This is a lightweight package ready for integration, containing just the
artifacts, with no extra dependencies. If for any reason you need access the
source code or other Solidity contracts deliverables see the
[`@mezo-org/orangekit-solidity`](../README.md) package.

## Usage

1. Install the package:

```sh
pnpm add @mezo-org/orangekit-contracts
```

2. Initialize Viem contract instance:

```typescript
import { getContract } from "viem"
import { orangeKitSafeFactoryConfig } from "@mezo-org/orangekit-contracts"

const orangeKitSafeFactory = getContract({
  ...orangeKitSafeFactoryConfig,
  client,
})
```
